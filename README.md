# Local Echo Toggle Command

This extension adds a command to quickly toggle (enable/disable) the Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal's local echo feature.

Currently this extension only works on the user/global settings. If a workspace or folder have their own local echo settings, those will take precedence and this extension does not support toggling those.
